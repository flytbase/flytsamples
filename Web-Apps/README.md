# Web Apps
These are web apps that can either be deployed onboard the companion computer (on the drone) running FlytOS or on a remote server. Web apps provide an easy way to interact with the drone. These apps use the RESTful and Websocket APIs. Download [FlytSDK Web](https://downloads.flytbase.com/flytos/downloads/sdk/Flyt_Web_SDK.zip) to develop web applications for your drone.

This section contains sample web apps built using Flyt APIs:
